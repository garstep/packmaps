To view the app as it progresses, visit its Github Test Page: https://garstep.github.io/packmaps

PackMaps is an application that takes individual user input of their locations, then displays a map plotting the locations of all of the users, based on population density per region. It is built using Google Maps Earthquake API from this source: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/earthquakes

Coming soon: Users can also upload images to their location; others can click on the map circles to view a list of the images.
